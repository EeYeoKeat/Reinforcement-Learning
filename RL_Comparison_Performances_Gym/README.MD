# Reinforcement Learning Performance in OpenAI Gym Environment






### Taxi-v3

| Agents        | Overall Mean Scores	 |  Time Taken(s) |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | -------------- |
|SARSA		|     	-357.88		 |     194.05	  |
|SARSA Lambda	|     	-355.83		 |     214.98	  |
|Q-Learning	|     	-340.10		 |     238.96	  |
|R-Learning	|     	-339.16		 |     292.16	  |



**Note:** 
1. All of the agents were trained with same hyperparameter settings including number of games, learning rate and initial epsilon values.ss
2. All of the experiments results shown are based on single execution only, it will be more appropriate if run 30 independent executions to obtain statiscal results.
