## Dynamic Programming

*Dynamic programming* (DP) is an algorithmic technique for solving an complex problem by breaking the problem into subproblems. It solve each recursive subproblem without repititive computation. Therefore, DP mainly can reduce the computation time and the iteration based algorithm terminates when convergence is achieved.

Most common DP technique:

1. Value Iteration
2. Policy Iteration
